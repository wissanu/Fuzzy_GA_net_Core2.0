Fuzzy Genetic for data mining problem using .net core2.0

mainly focus on create an model as classification for solving a diabetic problem from source (Pima indian).

preparation
------------------------------
The data form is a number from 1 to 7.
So, data transformation is needed.

------------------------------------------------
classification
-----------------------------------
there are 3 consisting parts in this model.

- genetic algorithm
- Trapezoidal membership function ( as rule )
- Fuzzy calculation ( as calculated probability to rule )

------------------------------------

The evaluation method is consist of full-train, percentage split and K-fold validations.
