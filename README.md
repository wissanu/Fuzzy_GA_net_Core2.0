# Fuzzy_GA
Fuzzy Genetic for data mining problem using .net core2.0

mainly focus on create an model as classification for solving a diabetic problem from source (Pima indian).

there are 3 consisting parts in this model.

1.) genetic algorithm
2.) Trapezoidal membership function ( as rule )
3.) Fuzzy calculation ( as calculated probability to rule )


The evaluation method is consist of full-train, percentage split and K-fold validations.
